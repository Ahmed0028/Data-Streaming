 #  Data Streaming Nanodegree Program


This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Data Streaming Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-streaming-nanodegree--nd029) program. It consists of a bunch of tutorials and Projects for various Data Streaming systems topics such as Apache Spark, Kafka, Spark Streaming, and Kafka Streaming . 
In most cases, the tutorials lead you through implementing the fundamentals of stream processing, including how to work with the Apache Kafka ecosystem, data schemas, ApacheAvro, Kafka Connect and REST proxy, KSQL, and Faust Stream Processing.

In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by Udacity experts, but they are available here as well.




## Projects :
#### [Optimize Chicago Public Transit](https://github.com/Ahmed0028/NLP-Nandodegree/blob/master/Program-projects/P1-%202-Project-HMMPartOfSpeechTagging/HMM%20warmup%20(optional).ipynb) 
- **Summary:** Use several modern data stream processing frameworks,to stream public transit status, using Kafka and the Kafka ecosystem, to build a stream processing application that shows the status of buses and trains in real time. you will learn how to have your own Python code produce events, use REST Proxy to send events over HTTP, and set up Kafka Connect to collect data from a Postgres database. Finally, you will utilize the Faust Python Stream Processing library to transform station data.
